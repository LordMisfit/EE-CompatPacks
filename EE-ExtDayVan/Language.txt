//Arriving at the evac center
EDAYTXT01 = "Look, it's that Wyck girl who's been crushing those things! Hey, can\n"
"you give us a hand here? We need to evacuate some other civilians, and\n"
"there's a huge group of those demonic monsters coming!";

EDAYTXT02 = "Watch out! There they come!";

//Kills the cyberdemon
EDAYTXT03 = "Thanks Miss Wyck! If it's not a problem, could you go inside and talk to the Captain?\n"
						"He's looking for stray Marines and others willing to fight to assemble a squad for a\n"
						"mission, and civilian or not, someone like you could be a big help to them! Good luck!";

//Talk to the captain
EDAYTXT04 = "...proceed with your orders and evacuate all civilians from this area immediately. \n"
"You have ten hours to reach a safe distance from the city, over.";

EDAYTXT05 = "You have to listen to me! This is not going to work! All I am asking you is \n"
"just one infantry platoon, over!";

EDAYTXT06 = "You have your orders Charlie Five, Command over and out.";

EDAYTXT07 = "Okay, then fuck you Goddammit!";

EDAYTXT08 = "(sighs) They refuse to deploy more units, they want to nuke the entire fucking city! \n"
"They don't understand, that portal can't be destroyed, it's some sort of organic thing! \n"
"We destroyed it with cruise missiles, three times, and it always rebuilds itself!";

EDAYTXT09 = "Our only hope is to capture that thing, get into the other side, and \n"
"shut it down from there.. And this is a difficult enough task without having the \n"
"portal surrounded by a nuclear wasteland.";

EDAYTXT10 = "I have watched these... things. And I understand their modus operandi. Their hordes are\n"
"attacking San Francisco now because they are attracted by large populations, they focus\n"
"their main forces on big battles and don't consider small groups like us a threat";

EDAYTXT11 = "You must help us! I know that a small unit can sneak into the city without attracting \n"
"much attention. You must go to downtown Los Angeles and secure the portal. If you have,\n"
"success I will be able to convince HQ to deploy more troops here to assist us. \n";

EDAYTXT12 = "I can spare a small squad to go with you. We got plenty of supplies, take whatever \n"
"you need and go!";

EDAYTXT13 = "Alright, here is the situation: All roads to downtown are blocked, we need to\n"
"find an alternative route. We also had to abandon several armored vehicles\n " 
"when we were retreating, and these things seems to know how to drive them.\n"
"So don't forget to bring some rockets with us.";

EDAYTXT14 = "The air force still got some birds dropping bombs around here, but we can't exactly \n"
"count on them. After we cross the next street, we are pretty much on our on.\n"
"There are no friendlies, no civilians, if you see anything moving, you destroy it!\n";

EDAYTXT15 = "Take everything you can carry, because we have a long walk until we reach downtown.\n"
"Let's move!";

EDAYTXT51 = "Attention all marine units, we are under attack by a non-human enemy force!\n"
"Everyone report to your combat stations. This is not a drill! \n"
"I repeat, this is not a drill, goddammit! \n";

EDAYTXT52 = "Attention all marine units, this is command. We are barricaded in the\n"
"Command Center and have been trying to send distress signals to Earth. Anyone out there\n"
"still alive report to our position. We got ammo and food. Godspeed. \n";

EDAYTXT53 = "Attention marines, we have been trying to send distress signals over the last\n"
"two hours, but nobody is responding, all we get is radio static, seems like no help.\n"
" is coming. We are moving up to the portal testing labs, storm the place,\n"
"secure the portals, and try to make a way to home. Command HQ over and out.\n";
